1) Work out how to update the hobbyInputs/Areas of interest for a user. 
2) If user is logged in they should not be able to see the login/register page. 
3) Write test code for the custom validator I created in areas of interest registration.
4) Add informative messages on disabled buttons to help users. 
5) Need to fix the server side validation for the basic registration component. 
6) Once API validation is complete comment both components where necessary and move on!
