var stringToParse = `===Agriculture===
The Bachelor of Science in Agriculture [B.Sc. (Ag) or B.Sc. (Hons.) Agriculture] offers a broad training in the sciences. The focus of this four-year applied degree is on the development of analytical, quantitative, computing and communication skills. Students learn how to apply the knowledge and principles of science to the understanding and management of the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products, and to the management and conservation of our natural resources. All students undertake rural field trips and approved professional experience within agricultural or horticultural enterprises, natural resource management, agribusiness industries, or commercial or government organisations active in the field.

===Architecture and design===
The [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) degree is a professional degree awarded to students who complete the five-year course of study in the field at some universities. Many universities offer a B.Sc. or B.A. (majoring in Architecture) after the first three or four years, and then a post-graduate diploma, B.Arch. or M.Arch. for the following two to four years.

The [[Bachelor of Design]] (B.Des., or S.Des. in Indonesia) is awarded to those who complete the four- or four-and-a-half-year course of study in design, usually majoring in a specific field of design, such as interior design or graphic design.

===Arts===
{{Main article|Bachelor of Arts}}

The Bachelor of Arts degrees (B.A., A.B.; also known as ''Artium Baccalaureus'') along with the [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees are the most common undergraduate degrees given. Originally, in the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]], all undergraduate degrees were in the faculty of arts, hence the name of the degree. The [[Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences]] (B.A.A.Sc.) is an undergraduate degree that bridges academic and work-life experiences.

===Engineering===
* The [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (''Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria'') degree or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ece.uwaterloo.ca |title=Electrical and Computer Engineering &#124; University of Waterloo |publisher=Ece.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> degree is a professional degree awarded to students who have completed the three- or four-year course of study in [[engineering]]. Common abbreviations include B.Eng., B.Sc.Eng., B.A.Sc., B.Tech., AMIE, and GradIETE. The B.A.I. ([[baccalaureus in arte ingeniaria]]) is awarded by the [[University of Dublin]] ([[Trinity College Dublin]]); some South African universities refer to their engineering degrees as B.Ing. (Baccalaureus Ingeniaria).
* There are more specific variants for many subfields, such as the B.Sc.E.Eng. degree (Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering). The B.Sc.Eng. and B.S.Eng (Bachelor of Software Engineering) are awarded by the [[University of Waterloo]], [[McMaster University]], and [[University of Victoria]], respectively. In India the [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Technology]], and AMIE (Association of Membership of Institution of Engineers) are professional degrees awarded in specific engineering disciplines such as computers, electrical, electronics, mechanical, communication, civil, plastics, chemical, etc. Specialization is referred to in brackets (e.g., "BE (computers)").
* The Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree (B.Sc.Eng.Tech.) is a [[professional degree]] awarded to students who have completed a four-year course of study in engineering technology. There are variants including general engineering technology, mechanical engineering technology, electrical engineering technology, and civil engineering technology. Some of these variants even have optional areas of concentration within them. For instance mechanical engineering technology could include mechanical systems design, manufacturing systems, marine engineering technology, and others. Engineering technology degrees usually lead to licensing as [[engineering technologist]]s requiring further studies for licensing as [[professional engineer]]s.

===Business and management===
:''See: [[Business education#Undergraduate education]].''

===Computer science and information systems===
There are various undergraduate degrees in [[information technology]] incorporating programming, database design, software engineering, networks and information systems. These programs prepare graduates for further [[postgraduate research]] degrees or for employment in a variety of roles in the [[information technology]] industry. The program focus may be on the technical or theoretical aspects of the subject matter, depending on which course is taken.
* Theoretically oriented degrees focus on [[computer science]] and are correspondingly titled. These include the [[Bachelor of Computing]] (B.Comp.) and [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] (B.Comp.Sc.) degrees. Computer science is also offered as a major within most [[Bachelor of Science]] programs.
* The practically oriented degrees cover many disciplines from within the [[information technology|IT industry]] including software engineering, information systems, and data communications. Examples here include the [[Bachelor of Science in Information Technology]] (B.Sc.I.T.), the [[Bachelor of Computer Applications]] (B.C.A.), the [[Bachelor of Information Technology]], and the Bachelor of Applied Science (Information Technology) (B.A.Sc.I.T.)) degrees. Many of the disciplines taught as part of these degrees are covered under other degrees, such as engineering, as well.
* Degrees combining IT with business study are also offered at many universities. Specialized programs in [[information systems]]—such as the [[bachelor of business information systems]] (BBIS) program—are often positioned as professionally oriented degrees. More general degrees here would include business degrees, such as the [[Bachelor of Business Administration|B.B.A.]] or [[Bachelor of Commerce|B.Com.]], with information systems as a concentration.

===Health Care===

====Medicine====
In countries following British tradition, (the [[University of Malta]] is an exception) medical students pursue an undergraduate medical education and receive [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|bachelor's degrees in medicine and surgery]] (M.B.B.Chir., M.B.B.S., B.M.B.S., B.M., M.B.Ch.B., etc.).
This was historically taken at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin after the initial B.A. degree, and in Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin the B.A. is still awarded for the initial three years of medical study, with the B.M.B.Ch., M.B.B.Chir., or M.B.B.Ch.B.A.O., respectively, being awarded for the subsequent clinical stage of training. Some British universities give a bachelor's degree in science, or medical science, midway through the medical course, and most allow students to intercalate a year of more specialized study for an intercalated Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.), Bachelor of Medical Science (B.Med.Sc.), or Bachelor of Medical Biology (B.Med.Biol.) degree with honors.
Although notionally M.B. and B.S. are two degrees, they must be taken together. In some Irish universities, a third degree, Bachelor of Arts in Obstetrics (B.A.O.), is added. However, this third degree is an anachronism from the 19th century and is not registerable with the Irish Medical Council. In the UK, these qualifications, while retaining the title of bachelor's degrees, are master's degree level qualifications.<ref name=FHEQmedical>{{cite web| page=29|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|date=November 2014|quote=First degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. While the final outcomes of the qualifications themselves typically meet the expectations of the descriptor for a higher education qualification at level 7/level 11, these qualifications may often retain, for historical reasons, titles of Bachelor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Surgery, Bachelor of Dental Surgery, Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine or Bachelor of Veterinary Science, and are abbreviated to MBChB or BM BS, BDS, BVetMed and BVSc respectively.}}</ref>

Use of the courtesy title of ''[[doctor (title)|doctor]]'' is attached to the profession of doctor or physician and is granted by registration, not by earning the qualifying degree. Trainee doctors in the UK are allowed to use the title once they begin their training and receive provisional registration.<ref name="Debrett's Medicine">{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/expertise/forms-of-address/professions/medicines/|title=Medicine|publisher=Debrett's|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|page=29|publisher=Quality Assurance Agency|accessdate=1 October 2016|date=October 2014|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/-/media/files/word%2520files/news%2520views%2520analysis/pressbriefing_medical%2520training%2520uk.doc|title=Medical Training in the UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010043302/http://bma.org.uk/-/media/Files/Word%20files/News%20views%20analysis/pressbriefing_medical%20training%20uk.doc|archive-date=10 October 2016|date=28 September 2012|publisher=[[British Medical Association]]|accessdate=20 September 2016|quote=Individuals in F1 posts receive a salary and are allowed to use the courtesy title 'Dr'.}}</ref>

Th Canadian MD degree is, despite its name, classified as a bachelor's degree.<ref name="Canadian Framework"/>

====Dentistry====
Dentistry is offered both as an undergraduate and a postgraduate course. In countries following the British model, the first degree in dentistry is the [[Bachelor of Dental Surgery]], which is a master's degree level qualification in the UK.<ref name=FHEQmedical/> In some parts of the world, the [[doctorate of dental surgery]] (DDS) is the usual undergraduate program. Postgraduate courses such as the [[Bachelor of Dentistry]] (B.Dent.)—awarded exclusively by the [[University of Sydney]] in Australia—requires a previous bachelor's degree.

====Midwifery====
The Bachelor of Midwifery degree is a professional degree awarded to students who have complete a three- to five-year (depending on the country) course of study in [[midwifery]]. Common abbreviations include B.Sc.Mid, B.Mid, B.H.Sc.Mid.

====Physiotherapy====
[[Physiotherapy]] is offered both as an undergraduate and a graduate course of study. Studies leading to the [[Bachelor of Physiotherapy]] (B.P.T.) degree usually constitute the undergraduate program. In the graduate program, courses leading to a degree such as the [[Master of Physiotherapy]] degree are offered.

In the [[Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]], French universities offer both undergraduate and graduate courses leading to the obtention of a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in physiotherapy and a Master of Science degree specialized in physiotherapy. [[McGill University]], the [[Université de Montréal]], and the [[Université de Sherbrooke]] are among the post-secondary institutions that offer such programs.

====Optometry====
Optometry is a four-year or five-year course. Although students graduate with a B.Sc. after three years of study, passing a further supervised preregistration year is required to become a fully qualified optometrist. The [[National Institute of Ophthalmic Sciences]] is among the post-secondary institutions that offer such programs. It is the academic arm of The Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital and the only eye hospital based institution in Malaysia.

====Nursing====
The Bachelor of Nursing degree is a three- to five-year undergraduate degree that prepares students for a career in [[nursing]]. Often the degree is required to gain "[[registered nurse]]", or equivalent, status—subject to completion of exams in the area of residence. Sometimes, though, the degree is offered only to nurses who are already registered. Alternate titles include [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] and Bachelor of Nursing Science, with abbreviations B.Sc.N., B.N.Sc.

====Veterinary science====
The [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science]] program is generally a five-year course of study that is required for becoming a [[veterinarian]]. It is also known as the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery at some universities (B.V.M.S.). In the UK, this is a master's degree level qualification that retains the title of bachelor's for historical reasons.<ref name=FHEQmedical>{{cite web| page=29|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/Publications/Documents/qualifications-frameworks.pdf|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|date=November 2014|quote=First degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. While the final outcomes of the qualifications themselves typically meet the expectations of the descriptor for a higher education qualification at level 7/level 11, these qualifications may often retain, for historical reasons, titles of Bachelor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Surgery, Bachelor of Dental Surgery, Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine or Bachelor of Veterinary Science, and are abbreviated to MBChB or BM BS, BDS, BVetMed and BVSc respectively.}}</ref> In the United States, no bachelor's degree of veterinary science is given, only the [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] (D.V.M.) degree is.

====Pharmacy====
The [[Bachelor of Pharmacy]] (B.Pharm.) degree is a common [[undergraduate degree]] for the practice of [[pharmacy]]. In the United States, [[Canada]], and [[France]], however, all colleges of pharmacy have now phased out the degree in favor of the [[Pharm.D.]], or [[doctor of pharmacy]], degree or the Ph.D., doctor of philosophy, degree in pharmacy. Some universities, such as the University of Mississippi, award a Bachelor of Science in pharmaceutical sciences (B.Sc.P.Sc.) degree as a part of the seven-year Pharm.D. program after the completion of the first four years. However, the B.ScP.Sc. degree does not qualify the recipient for the practice of pharmacy, for which it is required that students earn a Pharm.D. degree.

====Public Health====
[[Public health]] is usually studied at the [[master's degree]] level. The [[Bachelor of Science in Public Health]] (B.Sc.P.H.) degree is a four-year undergraduate degree that prepares students for careers in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors in areas such as public health, environmental health, health administration, epidemiology, or health policy and planning.

====Medical and Health Sciences====
* The Bachelor of Health Science (B.H.Sc./BSHS) is a specialized degree awarded to students whose studies have focused on health care, health sciences, or health professions. Specific areas of study can include nursing, radiography, health care management, and health education among the other broad areas of [[health sciences]]. Some BHSc/BSHS programs are intended for pre-requisite study to professional graduate programs, including [[physical therapy]], [[physician assistant]] studies, and [[medicine]]. The degree is typically awarded following four to five years of collegiate study.
* The title B.Med.Sc., B.Bio.Med.Sc., B.Med.Sc. or B.V.Med.Sc. is granted to students who have qualified in the field of [[biomedical scientist|biomedical science]] and [[medical science]] or veterinary medical science respectively. Universities that offer this course include the [[University of Western Ontario]] in Canada, [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK and the [[University of New South Wales]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[University of Queensland]], the [[University of Sydney]], [[RMIT University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Griffith University]], [[Monash University]], [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Melbourne]] in Australia.
* The degree of B.Med.Sc. can be awarded for students completing an intercalated degree whilst [[medical school|studying medicine]] as an intermediate award. The degree of B.Med.Sc. may also be awarded to an individual who, having followed the prescribed course of study for the degrees of [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|M.B.Ch.B.]], does not complete the undergraduate clinical training. In brief, this is normally awarded after the candidate has completed successfully the first three years of an undergraduate medical degree at certain UK (and Commonwealth) medical institutions.
* The [[Undergraduate Human Biology Program|Bachelor of Science in human biology]] degree is awarded by several universities around the world and focuses on biomedical research, health care, biotech business, pharmaceutical sciences, or a combination thereof.

====Kinesiology====
The Bachelor of [[Kinesiology]] degree (B.K. or B.Sc.K.)is a specialized degree in the field of human movement and kinetics. Some schools still offer it under the aegis of a School of [[Physical Education]] (B.P.Ed. or B.H.P.Ed.), although "kinesiology" or "human kinetics" is currently the more popularly accepted term for the discipline.

====Nutrition and Dietetics====
Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics (B.S.N.D.), Bachelor of Food Science and Nutrition (B.F.S.N.)
Specific areas of study include clinical nutrition, food technology, hospitality and services management, research, community worker, health care management, educator, sports science, agricultural sciences, private practice and other allied health fields.
The degree is awarded following four to six years of collegiate study in America (average five years), from three to four in Europe and Australia. In America (especially Latin America) Nutrition per se is separated from Dietetics, where the latter is equivalent to a technical degree.

===Aviation===
The [[Bachelor of Aviation]] (B.Av.) is awarded to students who complete a four-year course of study in the field of [[aviation]].

===Divinity and theology===
The [[Bachelor of Divinity]], [[Bachelor of Theology]], [[Bachelor of Religious Studies]], [[Bachelor of Biblical Studies]], and [[Bachelor of Religious Education]] (B.D., B.Th., B.R.S., B.B.S., and B.R.E.) degrees are awarded on completion of a program of study of [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] or related disciplines, such as [[theology]], [[religious studies]], or [[religious education]].

Traditionally the B.D. was in fact a graduate degree rather than a first degree, and typically emphasised academic theology, biblical languages etc. This has become a less common arrangement, but a B.D. takes precedence over a Ph.D. in Cambridge University's order of seniority.

While the theological bachelor's degree is generally conferred upon completion of a four-year program, it is also conferred in some specialized three-year programs. From there, the next level of advancement is generally the [[Master of Divinity]] (M.Div.), [[Master of Theology]] (Th.M.), [[Master of Religious Studies]], or [[Master of Religious Education]] <nowiki/>(M.R.E.) degree. In the United States the "main line" Protestant clergy typically take a four-year bachelor's degree in whatever field they choose, then earn the M.Div. (Master of Divinity) degree in an additional three years as part of preparation for ordination.

===Fine arts===
The [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (B.F.A.) degree is a specialized degree awarded for courses of study in the fine arts, frequently by an arts school or conservatory, although it is equally available at a significant number of traditional colleges and universities. In contrast to the B.A. or B.S., which are generally considered to be academic degrees, the B.F.A. is usually referred to as a professional degree, whose recipients have generally received four years of study and training in their major field as compared to the two years of study in the major field usually found in most traditional non-Commonwealth Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science programs.

In the United States, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a Bachelor of Arts degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component, as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes. A typical B.F.A. program in the United States consists of two-thirds study in the arts, with one-third in more general liberal arts studies. For a B.A. in Art, the ratio might be reversed.

===Film and television===
The [[Bachelor of Film and Television]] (B.F.T.V.) degree is an undergraduate degree for the study of film and television production including areas of cinematography, directing, scriptwriting, sound, animation, and typography.

===Integrated studies===
The [[Bachelor of Integrated Studies]] (B.I.S.) is an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree offered by several universities in the United States and Canada. It allows students to design a customized and specific course of study to best suit their educational and professional objectives. Generally, this degree is sponsored by two or more departments within the university. Schools which confer the B.I.S. degree include the [[University of Manitoba]], [[Pittsburg State University]], [[University of South Carolina Upstate]], [[Weber State University]], [[Ferris State University]], [[Arizona State University]], [[University of Minnesota]], Miami University (Ohio), the University of Virginia, the [[University of New Brunswick]], and [[Tallinn University of Technology]] amongst others.

===Journalism===
The [[Bachelor of Journalism]] (B.A.J. or B.Sc.J.) degree is a professional degree awarded to students who have studied journalism at a four-year accredited university. Not all universities, however, grant this degree. In the United States, schools tend to offer the B.A. or B.S. with a major in journalism instead. The world's oldest school of journalism at the [[University of Missouri]] offers a B.J. degree, not to be confused with the bachelor's degree in jurisprudence at Oxford University. In South Africa, [[Rhodes University]] has the oldest school of journalism in Africa and allows students to take a fourth-year specialisation to raise their B.A. to B.A.J. status, equivalent to a B.A. (Hons).x

===Landscape architecture===
The [[Bachelor of Landscape Architecture]] (B.L.Arch.) degree is awarded to students who complete the five- (in some countries four-) year course of study in the field.

===Liberal arts===
The [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts]], [[Bachelor of General Studies]], [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies]], Bachelor of Science in general studies, or Bachelor of Applied Studies (B.L.A., B.G.S., B.L.S., B.Sc.G.S., B.A.S.) degree is sometimes awarded to students who major in the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]], in general, or in interdisciplinary studies. The [[Bachelor of Professional Studies]] is awarded to students who major in professional career studies.

===Library science===
The [[Bachelor of Library Science]] or [[Bachelor of Library and Information Science]] (B.L.Sc., B.L.I.Sc.) degree is sometimes awarded to students who major in [[library science]], although Master's of library science degrees are more common.

===Music===
The [[Bachelor of Music]] (B.Mus.) degree is a professional or academic undergraduate degree in [[music]] at most conservatories in the US and the UK. It is also commonly awarded at schools of music in large private or public universities. Areas of study typically include music performance, music education, music therapy, music composition, academic fields (music history/musicology, music theory, ethnomusicology), and may include jazz, commercial music, recording technology, sacred music/music ministry, or music business. Small liberal arts colleges and universities without schools of music often award only B.A. in music, with different sets of requirements. (see also: ''[[Bachelor's degree#BFA|BFA]]'')

===Mortuary science===
The Bachelor of Mortuary Science (B.M.S.) is a professional undergraduate degree, awarded by the [[Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and Southern Illinois University Carbondale. It was introduced in 1986 and it is awarded to students that complete 120 semester hours of course work and receive passing scores on the National Board Exam administered by [[The International Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccms.edu/view/home/academics/degrees/bachelors.aspx |title=Bachelor |publisher=Ccms.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813070044/http://ccms.edu/view/home/academics/degrees/bachelors.aspx |archivedate=13 August 2011 }}</ref>

===Philosophy===
The [[Bachelor of Philosophy]] (B.Phil. or Ph.B.) degree is either an undergraduate or graduate degree. Generally, it entails independent research or a thesis/capstone project.

===Psychology===
The '''Bachelor of Arts or Science in Psychology''' (B.A.Psy., B.Sc.Psy., B.Psych., or Psy.B.) degree is a degree awarded to students who have completed a course of study in the field of [[psychology]]. Courses typically last five years, but may last as long as six. In Nepal, there are three- and four-year courses available for higher-level students. See [[Psychologist#Licensing and regulation]], [[Training and licensing of clinical psychologists]].

===Education===
The Bachelor of Education degree (B.Ed.) is a four-year undergraduate professional degree offered by many American colleges and universities for those preparing to be licensed as [[education|teachers]]. Variants include the B.Ed., B.A.Ed, B.A.T. (Bachelor of Arts for Teaching), and B.S.T. degrees. Preparation for the M.S. in education, this degree is most often received by those interested in early childhood, elementary level, and special education, or by those planning to be school administrators. Secondary level teachers often major in their subject area instead (i.e., history, chemistry, or mathematics), with a minor in education. Some states require elementary teachers to choose a subject major as well, and minor in education.

In Canada, the bachelor of education is a two-year professional degree in which students will specialise in either elementary or secondary education, and that is taken after the completion of a three or four year bachelor's degree with a major in a teachable subject, such as English, French, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, or a social science. Some universities also offer concurrent, five year programs with student completing both a bachelor's degree in arts or science as well as their B.Ed. The possession of a B.Ed. and a second bachelor's degree is required to teach in most public anglophone and francophone schools in Canada. The B.Ed. prepares teachers for completion of either M.A. (master's of arts) programs in education, M.Ed. (masters of education) programs, or post graduate certificates in education.

===Science with education===
The Bachelor of Science and/with Education degree (B.Sc.Ed.) is a degree awarded to students who complete the four- to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in General Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics) and education. Although notionally [[B.Sc.]] and B.Ed. are two degrees, they must be taken together. The graduates will work as science (physics, chemistry, biology) teachers in high schools, as lecturers in pre university colleges and matriculation centers and can progress to postgraduate programs ([[M.Sc.]] and [[Ph.D.]]) in various areas in science or education.

===Forestry===
The Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.Sc.F.) is a degree awarded to students who complete the four-year course of study in the field of forestry.

===Science===
{{Main article|Bachelor of Science}}
The Bachelor of Science degrees (B.Sc., Sc.B.) along with the [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees are the most common undergraduate degrees given. The [[Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences]] (B.A.A.Sc.) is an undergraduate degree that bridges academic and work-life experiences.

===Science in law===
The [[Bachelor of Science in Law]] degree (B.Sc.L.) is a special-purpose degree that allows someone who has had some prior studies but has not achieved a bachelor's degree to resume his or her education and take up the study of law with the goal of eventually receiving the [[juris doctor]] degree.

===Social sciences===
The [[Bachelor of Social Science]] (B.S.Sc.) is a three- or four-year [[undergraduate]] British degree that enables students to specialize in the area of [[social science]]. Compared to the Bachelor of Arts, which allows students to study a vast range of disciplines, the [[Bachelor of Social Science]] enables students to develop more central and specialized knowledge of the social sciences. Many universities place the [[Bachelor of Social Science]] between the Bachelor of Arts and [[Bachelor of Science]] undergraduate degrees.

===Social work===
The [[Bachelor of Social Work]] (B.S.W.) degree is a four-year undergraduate degree. Usually the first two years consist of liberal arts courses and the last two years focus on social work classes in human development, policy/law, research, and practice. Programs accredited by the [[Council on Social Work Education]] require B.S.W. students to complete a minimum of 400 field education or [[internship]] hours. Accredited B.S.W. programs often allow students who are interested in obtaining a [[Master of Social Work]] degree to complete the degree in a shorter amount of time or waive courses.
In Latin America this is a four to five year degree that can replace liberal arts subjects into health sciences, resulting in social work as a type of community psychology and socioeconomic studies, focused in hospitals, prisons or pedagogy, among others.

===Technology===
The [[Bachelor of Technology]] degree (B.Tech) is a three- or four-year undergraduate degree. Generally, the program is comparable to a Bachelor of Science degree program, which is additionally supplemented by either occupational placements (supervised practical or internships) or practice-based classroom courses.

===Law===
The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) is the principal academic degree in law in most [[common law]] countries other than the United States, and anglophone Canada, where it has been superseded by the [[juris doctor]] (J.D.) degree.

===Talmudic law===
The [[Bachelor of Talmudic Law]] degree (B.T.L.) or a First Talmudic Degree (F.T.D.) is the degree awarded in most [[Yeshivas]] around the United States.

===Tourism studies===
The Bachelor of Tourism Studies (B.T.S.) degree is awarded to those who complete the four- or five-year course of study in tourism, laws regarding tourism, planning and development, marketing, economics, sociology, anthropology, arts and world history (dependent on the country in which one takes the course), ticketing, hospitality, computer applications, and much more. The course would have an interdisciplinary approach with a vast range of units so the tourismologist professional would be able to identify necessary actions toward a sustainable touristic environment focus on local community uniqueness, values and traditions.
As tourism is a growing industry, in India there is a lot of opportunity for those who complete this course of study. It is available in select universities of India.

===Mathematics===
The [[Bachelor of Mathematics]] or [[Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences]] degree (B.Math. and B.Math.Sc.) is given at the conclusion of a four-year honors program or a three-year general program. Several universities, mostly in Canada and Australia, award such degrees. The usual degree for mathematics in all other countries is the B.Sc.

===Urban and regional planning===
The Bachelor of Urban and Regional Planning or Bachelor of Urban Planning or just Bachelor of Planning degree (B.U.R.P., B.U.P., or B.Plan) is a degree offered at some institutions as a four or five-year<ref>{{cite web|title=Bachelor of Urban Planning|url=http://daap.uc.edu/academics/planning/b_urban_planning.html|website=College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning, University of Cincinnati|accessdate=3 April 2015|ref=DAAP planning}}</ref> professional undergraduate degree in [[urban planning]]. Programs vary in their focus on studio work and may or may not involve professional practice.

===Public affairs and policy management===
The [[Bachelor of Public Affairs and Policy Management]] degree (B.P.A.P.Mgt.) is a specialized four-year honors degree dedicated to the study of public policy within an interdisciplinary framework. The degree was created as a direct response to the changing nature of civic society and the growing need for university graduates who can work effectively in the new policy environment.
